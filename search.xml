    <content type="text"><![CDATA[SSHFS (SSH Filesystem) is a filesystem client to mount and interact with files located on a remote server or workstation over a normal ssh connection. It’s safer and more convenient than nfs. And it’s helpful especially when we are facing multiple servers and large dataset.

Check whether the ssh works. If ssh works, sshfs will work.]]></content>
